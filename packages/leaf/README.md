A lightweight, fast web-components based frontend framework for the future.

## Introduction

Leafjs is a lightweight frontend framework built using web components and browser ES Modules.

Using web components allows you to create components natively - supported by most modern browsers. Unlike React and Vue, Leafjs's component system is totally built on top of the web component system.

And just like React, Leafjs implements a simple reactivity system that allows two-way binding, just like most frameworks do.

## Getting started

Use `create-leafjs-app` to get started:

```bash
$ npx create-leafjs-app my-app
$ # or
$ yarn create leafjs-app my-app
```

Then `cd` into your project directory and run `npm run dev` to start a development server.
