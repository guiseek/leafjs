# Installation

## Creating a new project

We recommend using `create-leafjs-app` (or `cla` for short) for newly created projects. CLA will automatically handle the development server and build process by interacting with Rollup JavaScript API.

However, using other bundlers such as Webpack may be possible - but with no offical support.

Simply run:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

    yarn create leafjs-app my-app

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="NPX">

    npx create-leafjs-app my-app

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To create a new app named `my-app`. Then `cd my-app` to go into the app directory and install the dependencies using either Yarn or NPM. Finally, run:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

    yarn dev

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm run dev

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To start a hot reloading development server.

Other commands such as `build`, `start` are also available.

## Adding Leaf to an existing project

To manually add Leafjs to an existing project, install the required packages:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

    yarn add @leaf-web/core @leaf-web/parser

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm i @leaf-web/core @leaf-web/parser

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then in your `package.json`, add the following scripts:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "leaf build",
    "dev": "leaf dev",
    "start": "leaf start"
  }
}
```

Where `build` is used to build production-ready bundles and `dev` to start a hot-reloading development server. The `start` command is to serve the bundle produced by `build`. However, the `start` command should only be used for testing purposes - it contains **no** optimization!
