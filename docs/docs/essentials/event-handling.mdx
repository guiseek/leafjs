# Event Handling

Without events, you can't even listen for a button click. Events play a big part in modern frontend development. This article will show you how to handle events in Leafjs.

## Event listeners

A watcher, or listener for an event that will be fired when it recieved a new event is called an **event listener**. An event listener can be either listening a plain DOM element or a custom element.

In Leaf, you can add an event listener to an element using attributes starting with on-. For example:

```jsx
class MyButton extends LeafComponent {
  render() {
    return <button onClick={() => console.log('button clicked!')}>Hello World</button>;
  }
}
```

This will register a `click` event listener for the button element. When the user clicks the button, it will log `button clicked!` in the console.

The above code may seem like a HTML inline listener, but it isn't.

Leaf parses the listener and extracts the event name `click` and then calls `element.addEventListener` to add the event listener to an element.

## Dispatching an event

Sometimes you want to have a custom event for your component, e.g. a custom button element may have a custom click event handler. Here's an example of that:

```jsx
class MyButton extends LeafComponent {
  render() {
    return <button onClick={(e) => this.fireEvent(e)}>My button</button>;
  }
}
```

Here we added a click listener for the inner button. When the inner button gets clicked, it will fire the click event to the listeners of `<MyButton />` component.

In `LeafComponent.fireEvent`, Leaf automatically handles the passed in `Event` object to prevent the event reaching anywhere outside the component. Then, Leaf dispatches a new event with the same event type.

If you want to pass some data to the listeners, for example that you are building an input component. In this case, pass your data as the second argument of `fireEvent`:

```jsx
class MyInput extends LeafComponent {
  render() {
    return <input onChange={(e) => this.fireEvent(e, { value: e.target.value })} />;
  }
}
```

This event will attach the data section (the second argument) to `event.detail`, which the `value` field can be accessed through `event.detail.value`:

```jsx
class OtherComponent extends LeafComponent {
  render() {
    return <MyInput onChange={(e) => console.log(e.detail.value)} />;
  }
}
```

### Custom events

Sometimes you want more than events received from existing DOM elements. A todo app may have a `<AddTodo />` component which needs logic for adding todos. We can achieve this by passing in a string instead of an `Event` object:

```jsx
class AddTodo extends LeafComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* ... */}
        <button onClick={() => this.fireEvent('add', { name: '...' })}>Add Todo</button>
        {/* ... */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

This will fire an `add` event to listeners. You can setup an event listener for it like so:

```jsx
class TodoApp extends LeafComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {/* ... */}
        <AddTodo onAdd={(e) => console.log('add todo', e.detail.name)} />
        {/* ... */}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

Which is just like a normal listener.

## Listener for non-Leaf projects

While we recommended using Leaf components with Leafjs, some component libraries may target vanilla JavaScript. To add an event listener for a Leaf component in vanilla JS, simply do:

```js
const myComponent = document.getElementById('my-component-id');
myComponent.addEventListener('click', () => { /* ... */ });
```

Or you can also do it inline-style, but this is not recommended. [Read more.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6348597)
