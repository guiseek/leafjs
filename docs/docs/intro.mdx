# Introduction

## What is Leafjs

Leafjs is a lightweight frontend framework built using web components and browser ES Modules.

Using web components allows you to create components natively - supported by most modern browsers. Unlike React and Vue, Leafjs's component system is totally built on top of the web component system.

And just like React, Leafjs implements a simple reactivity system that allows two-way binding, just like most frameworks do.

## Getting Started

Because Leafjs targets browser ES Moudles, so no transpilation is needed to use Leafjs: just plain JavaScript!

Here's a template:

Note that whenever you need to use Leafjs, add the `type="module"` attribute to the `<script />` tag.
