# Introduction

## What is Leafjs

Leafjs is a lightweight frontend framework built based on web components.

Using web components allows you to create components natively - supported by [most modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=web%20components). Unlike React and Vue, Leafjs's component system is totally built on top of the web component system, meaning that you can even use your components through native tags inside a plain HTML file as long as importing your bundled code.

And for sure, Leafjs implements a simple reactivity system that allows two-way binding, just like most frameworks do.

## Getting Started

Leafjs provides a out-of-the-box bundle tool for you to use. Run the following command in your shell to create a new Leafjs app:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

    yarn create leafjs-app my-app

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npx" label="NPX">

    npx create-leafjs-app my-app

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then run `cd my-app` to go into the app directory. Then install the dependencies using either Yarn or NPM. After that, run:


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

    yarn dev

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

    npm run dev

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To start a hot reloading development server.

Or if you just wanted to play around with Leafjs online, here's a simple CodeSandbox for you:
